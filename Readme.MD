# PF-Lus

First of all this project is based on the classifier created in the first assignment.
However, since I need the confidence of the predictions I change it slightly.
In order to ensure that the project is going to work, the classifier should be in the same path required
in the controller.php file.
However this project is given with the naive bayes already trained and ready to classify.
The only thing that must be trained is the Concept tagger, which is not given as already trained,
since it is very big. The trained classification model must be in the classifier folder and
named "crf.lm", must be in the path = project/classifier/crf.lm.
In order to be fully working the project must be available at http://localhost/project/index.html .
In addition the classifier must be trained and fully working.
